A Chrome extension for measuring the relevance of the subject of a Wikipedia article. This is currently done by using the language-number rule of thumb: the bigger the number of languages the article exists in, the higher the subject relevance. The number of languages is displayed as badge text over the extension icon. The relevance is also color-coded (the redder, the better). Be sure to pin the extension!

## Obsolescence

With the more widespread adoption of the new Wikipedia look (in January 2023, even the English Wikipedia adopted it), the utility of this extension has dropped. In the top right corner, the new Wikipedia look includes the number of **other** languages in which an article is available. This essentially means that the number displayed by this extension is equal to the number displayed by Wikipedia plus one.
